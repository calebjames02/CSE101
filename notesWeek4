When looking at predecessor subgraph
Every time you are going down you are discovering a new vertex, and each time you go up you are finishing

Modify DFS to classify the types of edges as you go
See problem 22.3 problem 12 3rd edition for hints
if color[y] == white
	p[y] = x
	Visit(y)
	// tree edges
else if color[y] == gray
	
else if color[y] == black
	


Topological Sort
A graph is acyclic if it has no cycles
	A cycle is a path where you can start at one vertex and end at the same vertex
Graphs are either cyclic or not acyclic

Lemma:
A digraph G is acyclic if and only if DFS(G) yields no back edges
	Ordering of edges run in DFS does not matter

Changing name of vertices can change the classification of edges, however it will will not change if the graph is acyclic or not acyclic

Definition:
An acyclic digraph is called a DAG (directed acyclic graph)
Let G be a DAG
	A topological sort of the vertex set of G is a linear ordering on the vertex set of G [V(G)], such that if the ordered pair (x,y) is in the edge set of G then x appears before y in the linear order
	When you draw in the edges on this graph, they all go from left to right
	There could possibly be more than one topological sort for a graph

The topological sort of a scheduling problem is the schedule you can use to complete the tasks

Topological sort algorithm is DFS
To find a topological sort
	Run DFS(G), as vertices finish push them onto a stack: S
	When done, S is the topological sort from top to bottom
When there are multiple topological sorts, you get one of them based on what order the loop goes through the vertices in DFS

Strongly Connected Components
Let G be a digraph. We say y that is a vertex in v is reachable from x that is a vertex of v if and only if G contains a directed x-y path

Definition:
We call G strongly connected if and only if for all x,y in the vertex set of G, x is reachable from y and y is reachable from x and vice versa

Definition:
A subset U of the vertex set of G is strongly connected iff for all x,y in U, x is reachable from y and y is reachable from x and vice versa

Definition:
A subset U ov the vertex set of G is a strongly connected component (SCC) of G iff
	1) U is strongly connected
	2) U is maximal with respect to property 1

To get this SCC
	Run DFS(G), as vertices finish put them onto a stack S
	Compute the G^T (G transpose)
	Run DFS(G^T), execute the main loop in stack order given by S
When you are done you have a bunch of vertices in trees
The trees are the SCCs

Midterm will covering everything through today

To get correct order for SCC read out the list after running DFS on the transpose based on the list from the first
	run of DFS and go from bottom to top of the stack and each SCC ends when a vertex has parent NIL

Definition
GSCC is the digraph with V={SCC of G} (vertex set = SCC of G}
E = {(i, j) | x is an element of SCCi, y is an element of SCCj, and (x,y) is an edge in the edge set of G}
A GSCC will always be acyclic
The GSCC will show the topoligcal sort of the Graph

To find order for the SCC output for pa3
Walk up the stack until you find NIL
	Then print going down from the NIL

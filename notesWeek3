For BFS start at source, then find vertices at distance 1, then find vertices at distance 2 ...
Uniformly expanding to find new vertices

distance[x] = estimate of edge traversals between s and x
parent[x] = encodes shortest paths

Predecessor tree is creating by drawing each vertex pointed to by their parents
The depth of each vertex is the distance between it and the source vertex
If at depth 0, 0 length, if at depth 3, 3 length
Single slash through a drawn vertex means it is gray, no slash means it is white

Will be asked to draw predecessor graph ON EXAM!!
The shortest path that you get from BFS is decided by the order in which the adjacency list is processed
Could be asked to give order in which vertices are entered and removed from the queue and the distances

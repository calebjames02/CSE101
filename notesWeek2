A Graph G=(V, E) where
	V = set of vertices
	E = set of edges between the vertices (unordered set of pairs of vertices)

Ex.
V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
E = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}} or {12, 34} <- the second one works as long as the two vertices are distinct

An isomorphism is a mapping or function (symbol fi)
V(G1)->V(G2) such that {x, y} is in the edge set of (G1) this is true if and only if {fi(x), fi(y)} is an element
in the edge set of G2
All vertices point of one graph can be replaced with the vertices of another graph and the edges are the same
	The visual representation may differ, but the vertices and edges are interchangeable

How to check for isomorphism
Check to see if have same number of vertices
Check to see if have same number of edges
And other things
No finite set of simple checks you can do to prove two different graphs are isomorphic

Our definition of graph does not allow a vertex to have an edge with itself, it also does not allow
	parallel edges (an edge pointing from vertex a to b and from vertex b to a)
Graphs that allow the above are multigraphs

Adjacency can be between edges and vertices (they are both connected)
Degree of a vertex is how many edges are connected to it
Handshake Lemma
	Total degree of all vertices should be two times the number of edges
	Also: number of odd degree vertices in a graph must be even

Definitions:
an x-y walk is a sequence of vertices x = v0, v1, v2, v3, ... vk=y such that the pair of {vi-1, vi} is an edge
	In other words every pair of consecutive vertices in the list are adjacent
	The length of the walk is k, the number of edges traversals
	if x = y, then the walk is closed. if length = 0, then the walk is trivial
	a walk in which no edge is traversed multiple times is called a trail
	a trail in which no vertex is visited more than once is called (unless the trail is closed) is called a path
A non trivial closed path is called a cycle
	Forests are graphs that have no cycles

A graph is called connected if and only if for every pair of vertices there is an x-y path, otherwise it is called disconnected

A subgraph H of G is a graph H=(V', E') such that V' is a subset of the vertex set of G and E' is a subset of the edge set of G

A conneced component in a Graph G is a subgraph H of G such that
	1) H is connected
	2) H is maximal with respect to property one
Maximal means that there is no larger subgraph that contains the smaller subgraph that is also connected

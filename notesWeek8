BSTs
Keys must be unique, values don't have to be

Leaf - node with no children
All nodes that are not leaves are internal nodes

NIL is one node that exists that all pointers point to if they do not point to another node
NIL parent and child nodes can point to NIL, or you can set pointer to NULL or nullptr

Inorder traversal prints the BST starting from a given node by 
	Print left
	Print current
	Print right

Preorder
	Current
	Left
	Right

Post order
	Left
	Right
	Current

Can reconstructor from preorder or post order
To reconstruct from preorder
Look at first node
Any nodes following that are smaller are on the left
Any nodes following that are larger are on the right
Place first smaller node as left child and first larger node as right child
Keep going from the new nodes

Postorder traversal is used to free all the nodes

Tree search
If NIL or val == search - can't reverse this or it would segfault because NIL does not have a key
	Return pointer to current node
If val < search
	Recurse right
If val > search
	Recurse left

Height of a tree is the depth fo the deeest leaf (how many nodes away the frathest node is away from the root

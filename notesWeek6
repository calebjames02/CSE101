Can we use namespace std?
Where are front and back dummy?

Only difference between struct and class in C++ is that class has defualt of private variables and struct has
	default of public variables

Bitwise and - C/C++
Address of - C/C++
References operator - C++ only
A reference variable is an alias for some other variable, similar to a pointer but doesn't use pointer syntax
	Like a pointer that doesn't need to be dereferenced
int x;
int y = &x;
int& r = x;
	Reference to int
	Must be initialized at the time it is declared
x = 6;
x++;
(*p)++; - Increment x
r++; - Increments x
	This is mostly pointless to do it this way, however it is used to pass variables to functions by reference
		without having to make a pointer of it

Const is used to create syntax errors to catch if you modify things in functions where you shouldn't

Use nullptr instead of NULL

For = operator
Create a copy of given list
Swap pointers from the copy to the self object
	std::swap(front, temp.front);
	...
Constructor called by default
	List L - Constructor called here
Copy constructor
	List S
	List L = S

Assignment operator
	List L
	List S
	L = S
